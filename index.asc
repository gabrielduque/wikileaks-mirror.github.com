== Wikileaks Mirror Coming Here Soon...

This https://github.com/wikileaks-mirror[GitHub Account] has been setup with the SSH key from http://wikileaks.ch/mass-mirror.html[this instructional page].

The Wikileaks mirror folks should clone the GitHub repository found https://github.com/wikileaks-mirror/wikileaks-mirror.github.com[here], add the mirror content, commit it, and `git push origin master`.

That should just work. Afterwards, this page ( http://wikileaks-mirror.github.com/ ) should then be a mirror. It will also be a git repository of the content. :)

=== Issues

While there is a very close match between the current Wikileaks' mirror
process and Github gh-pages virtual hosting, I realize it's not an
exact match from the automation PoV.

Here are some issues I can think of:

* Space - the free account currently offers a 0.3GB soft limit. I am willing
  buy more space if needed, but maybe the huge files can be left out.
* Of the 4 instructions listed http://wikileaks.ch/mass-mirror.html[here],
  this process gets the last 3 right. The only difference is that we
  need to do git+ssh instead of rsync+ssh. Is this problematic?
** Supporting git as a mirror transfer, might just be a good idea anyway.

That's all I can think of now. Leave a msg on github if you have ideas,
questions or concerns.
